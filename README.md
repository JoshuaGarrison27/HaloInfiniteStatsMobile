# Halo Infinite Mobile App

[![Build status](https://build.appcenter.ms/v0.1/apps/14a145b8-0657-4b4d-9d77-f5ea2f0e067b/branches/master/badge)](https://appcenter.ms)

I wanted to learn how to develop Xamarin Forms app. Halo Infinite had just released and I found this cool public API from Autocode.com! So it just seemed like a fun little project to start with. Hope you enjoy.

I don't own Apple products, so the project does not focus on building for iOS. However, feel free to contribute and submit a PR!

## Getting Started

To start debugging this application, there are a few steps you need to complete.

### Prerequisites
- [Autocode Api Key](https://autocode.com/)


1. Rename the `secrets.json.example` to `secrets.json`
> Note: You will get a warning saying secrets.json has been deprecated. Ignore this error for now. I could not figure out how to fix it for the BuildTools NuGet project.
2. Paste your Autocode API Key into the string property for the HaloApiToken
3. Build the app within your IDE and start debugging.
