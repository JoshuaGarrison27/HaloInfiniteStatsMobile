# Halo Infinite Mobile App

I wanted to learn how to develop Xamarin Forms app. Halo Infinite had just released and I found this cool public API from Autocode.com! So it just seemed like a fun little project to start with. Hope you enjoy.

I don't own Apple products, so the project does not focus on building for iOS. However, feel free to contribute and submit a PR!

### Prerequisites:
- [Autocode Api Key](https://autocode.com/)


1. Rename the `buildtools.json.example` to `buildtools.json`
2. Paste your Autocode API Key into the `defaultValue` property for the HaloApiToken
3. Build the app within your IDE and start debugging.
